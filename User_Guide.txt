User Guide for MineSweep

The numbers in the grid represent the total number of mines in the eight grids around a grid.

Left Click: 

When clicking on an unknown cell, if the cell is a mine, you will lose the game. If this grid is not a mine, the number of mines around this grid and the grid connected to this grid that is not a mine will be displayed.
